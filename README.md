Film Noir Database Website

I created this project in 2020 as a means of learning the Django web framework and full-stack web development, though my primary interests are Python,
Django and databases. This project is meant to be a snapshot of everything I've learned this year. Film Noir was an easy choice for my first database project,
as I'm a long-time fan of the genre. This project also including formulating the dataset (film noir movies and their details, cast members, crew members, etc) via
web scraping scripts that I wrote in Python. I then populated the database from my datasets. The website also includes user accounts, with a focus on simple, fun
user interaction: registered users can mark movies as "seen", add them to a Favorites list, add them to a Watchlist, and write reviews. Reviews use a 5-star rating
system, and each movie page shows that film's average rating, plus all of its reviews. This functionality encourages users to use the site as a way of finding new
Noirs to watch, and tracking their progress through all the Noirs contained in the database (581 total: the 'classic American period' from 1943 - 1958).
