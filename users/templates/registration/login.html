<!-- random note: previously, the button tag had name="submit" instead of type="submit". I believe the result is identical, but it has me a bit confused about what 'name' means, as tag property. 

    ANSWER: the *default* type of button is submit. when you did name='submit,' you were indeed
    giving it a 'name' of submit, and *it was not giving it submit functionality*. The only reason
    it worked is because the default type is submit, and you didn't specify a type. So, it was still submit, but it's worth understanding that this is NOT becuase of the name='' property!
